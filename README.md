### The Challenge

Build out the NFT preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### My First Page Iteration

I blocked out the card and page using HTML and CSS, using the client-specified colours.

I attempted to get it as close to the design preview as possible using a variety of things, such as: CSS selectors, flexbox, and more.
